# osc2vrpn

This tool acts as a OSC-server and a vrpn-server. It receives messages via osc and makes them available for vrpn clients connected to the vrpn server.

The tool is developed for audio applications in reasearch projects of the audiocommunication group of the TU Berlin (www.ak.tu-berlin.de). It is needed to use osc-only devices with vrpn capable software like the soundscape renderer (http://spatialaudio.net/ssr/) or any other vrpn application.
